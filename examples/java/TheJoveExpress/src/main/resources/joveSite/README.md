# TheJoveExpress Train Control
This is a standalone React train control app.
It is a heavily modified version of [Reweather](https://github.com/alwint3r/reweather) and uses MQTT.js and React Redux to communicate with the train.

There's a lot more work to be done with this app, primarily some clean up, performance issues (strange lag sometimes), and restructuring of files.

Ideally, this app lives inside of the hosted train.
