// MQTTSubscription and MQTTRegistration are RAII owners of the subscribe and
// register requests. When all references goes to nil, the unsubscribe/unregister
// happens.
// If the referance is reassigned it is important to note the unaction of the old
// value happens after the action of the new value. If the reference is reused
// you may choose to set it to nil before the assignement.
